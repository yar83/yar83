#### 🙋‍♂️ Hi!

I'm a **web** developer with strong interest to back-end and automatization. Actively search <br/>great opportunities to get new experience in web development and **DevOps**.

:wrench: Now mostly work as a freelancer but open for any proposals to take part in interesting project<br/>
or join a nice team.<br/>

🌱 Nowadays I want make Grid and Flex to be my best friends so that project i'm working on were<br/>
completely compatible across all browsers and screen resolutions.
